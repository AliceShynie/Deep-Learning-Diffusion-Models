# Deep-Learning-Coursework
Abstract : This report discusses briefly about the mathematics behind denoising diffusion models and their implementations. 
LSUN dataset set is used to train the model and the results are discussed by displaying non cherry picked images, cherry 
picked images, their average perceptual similaries and their interpolations from the nearest neighbour. The limitations of this 
project is discussed.

Skills Accuired: 
    - Python
    - Understanding and application of probabilistic models, specifically denoising diffusion models.
    - Implementation of the UNET architecture and working with complex neural network structures.
    - Utilization of LSUN dataset for model training.
    - Application of mathematical concepts, such as Gaussian transitions and variational bounds, in the context of diffusion models.
    - Evaluation of model results through perceptual similarity metrics.
    - Awareness of model limitations and suggestions for improvement.
